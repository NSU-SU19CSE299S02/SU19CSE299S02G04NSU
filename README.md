 ## Project Idea:

 We are trying to solve the real-life problem in which people store their products in a place through App. It will be easy to find and store something. Our main goal is to serve a good and time efficient app that can help to collaborate easily between the stores and the customers.

At earlier stage, people stored their products that uses paperwork and hard-copy materials. But they did find difficulties when someone came to them and asked him to give information about what the stored items.

We are trying to solve the problem and make it easy for user and also for the manager of the store. And also, for easy payment we are using online payment method. As all the information is in the app, so people can find the information of their products easily.


## What problem are we trying to solve?

- Many small businesses have to store their products. But due to their lake of space, storing their products becomes more difficult. 
- Many stores have the ability to store others products. But their locations are not known to everybody who are willing to store.
- Management is difficult in these paper-based stores.
- Storing ability and the pricing is difficult and one has to go in person to know the storing and pricing options, which is time consuming.
- The ability to compare the prices and environments between the stores is not well known.
- Shifting for products is not efficient.
- Contacting to the store to know the condition and information of the product is difficult

## How would our product solve the problem?
- We are trying to solve the complexity of the management and the people who are willing to store things in a particular store for a particular time.
- The location-based system helps the customers to know the distance from their businesses-place to the store for easy and less-costly shipping.
- The store management have their own transportation to collect the products and to take the products back to customers. So, the customers don’t have to worry about the shipping methods.
- The resources and costs are well known to customers. So, they can compare with different stores and decide which store to choose.
- They can easily access the store availability and check their older records.
- Easy Payment, they can pay their money through online payment option.
